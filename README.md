# metalsmith-etsy-boilerplate
Essential boilerplate code to get you up and running with a custom Etsy website.

## Installation
    $ git clone http://github.com/selfVSmind/metalsmith-etsy-boilerplate.git
    $ cd metalsmith-etsy-boilerplate
    $ npm install
    
## Requirements
You must [register for and Etsy API key](https://www.etsy.com/developers/register) and enter that key in **build.js**.

My Etsy shop name is filled in for demonstration purposes so keep that or change it to your own shop.

The **listing_template** field is important. Right now it is set to a Handlebars template. You can change the project to use Jade instead and update the template.

## Build
    $ node build
    
## What's Next?
Now I suggest you brush off your CSS skills and make this site worth looking at. Have fun!
